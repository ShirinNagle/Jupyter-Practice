# Jupyter-Tasks

This Jupyter notebook, conatains the work related to solving 4 tasks, set by Lecturer Dr. Ian McLoughlin.
The tasks are listed below.
### Task 1

Write a Python function called sqrt^2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.  Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1or otherwise.  You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

### Task 2

The  Chi-squared  test  for  independence  is  a  statistical hypothesis test like at-test.  It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent.  The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4],stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Usescipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated pvalue.  You should include a shortnote with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.

||A|B|C|D|Total|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|White collar|90|60|104|95|349|
|Blue collar|30|50|51|20|151|
|No collar|30|40|45|35|150|
|Total|150|150|200|150|650|

### Task 3

The  standard  deviation  of  an  array  of  numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)).However,  Microsoft  Excel  has  two  different  versions  of  the  standard  deviation calculation,STDEV.P and STDEV.S.  TheSTDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x).  Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cellabout  the  difference  between  them.   Then  use numpy to  perform  a  simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standardd eviation of a population when performed on a sample.  Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence.

### Task 4

Use scikit-learn to  apply k-means  clustering  to Fisherâ€™s  famous  Iris  data  set.   You  will  easily  obtain  a  copy  of  the  data  set  on-line.  Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.

## How to run Jupyter Notebook[1].
1. Ensure Anaconda is installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your computer.
3. Navigate to where you have cloned the repository, using cmd(Windows)
4. Type jupyter notebook on the cmd, this will launch a new browser window or new tab.
5. When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). 
No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders.
6. Double click on the file titled jupyter-tasks.ipynb
7. The notebook should open, with all tasks displayed and the work involved in proving these tasks.
8. For further information please see link below.
